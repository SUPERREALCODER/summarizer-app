            "Received JSON: {'input_type': 'text', 'input_source': 'Gayan was not an ordinary pig. While most pigs were content to roll in the mud and munch on apples, Gayan had dreams—big dreams. He wanted to see the world beyond Farmer Ted’s barnyard. His pink snout quivered with excitement every time a bird flew overhead, every time the wind carried the scent of adventure from faraway places.  One evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of orange and purple, Gayan made up his mind. He would escape and explore the world! But he needed a plan. Unlike the barn cats who could slip through the smallest gaps, or the clever hens who had their secret tunnels, Gayan had to rely on his wits.  The opportunity came sooner than expected. One morning, Farmer Ted left the gate slightly ajar while carrying a heavy sack of feed. Gayan’s heart raced. This was it! With a deep breath, he charged through the opening and dashed toward freedom, his little hooves kicking up dust.  Gayan’s first stop was the dense forest at the edge of the farm. He had heard the stories from the older animals about wild beasts lurking there, but he was too excited to be afraid. The trees stood tall and mysterious, their leaves whispering secrets. As he wandered deeper, he met a wise old owl named Oswald.  “You’re far from the barnyard, little pig,” Oswald hooted from a low branch. “What brings you here?”  “I want to see the world!” Gayan declared proudly.  Oswald chuckled. “Then you must be careful. The world is big and full of surprises, both good and bad.”  Gayan nodded, determined to prove himself. He continued his journey, eventually reaching a wide river. He had never seen so much water before! But how would he cross? As he pondered, a family of beavers approached.  “You look lost,” said Benny, the eldest beaver.  “I need to get across,” Gayan explained.  The beavers, always eager to build, decided to help. They constructed a sturdy raft using branches and vines. Gayan climbed aboard, and with a push, he drifted across the river, his heart soaring with excitement.  Beyond the river, Gayan found a bustling town. People hurried through the streets, carrying baskets of goods. The smell of fresh bread made his stomach rumble. He tiptoed into a bakery, drawn by the warm scent. Just as he was about to nibble a fallen pastry, a young girl spotted him.  “A pig in the bakery!” she cried, laughing.  The baker, instead of shooing him away, smiled and offered him a fresh apple. “You must be a traveler,” he said. “Where are you headed?”  Gayan thought for a moment. He had seen a forest, crossed a river, and now stood in a town. He had tasted adventure. But suddenly, he missed the familiar sounds of the barn, the cozy hay, and even Farmer Ted’s voice.  Maybe, just maybe, home was the greatest adventure of all.  And so, with a heart full of memories and a belly full of apples, Gayan made his way back to the farm, where he was welcomed with open arms. After all, a pig’s place was not just in a barn—but in the stories he carried back with him.'}\n"
